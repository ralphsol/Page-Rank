In the implementation we have to enter the input size of the number of pages and by using the page rank algorithm, the ranks of all the pages get computed.
Here, some of the notations are as :
size	 : number of pages, by default 100
feedIn	 : two-dimensional square matrix (size x size)containing randomly generated 0/1 as it's entries
u		 : one-dimensional identity matrix (size x 1)
P		 : it is same as feedIn just that all the elements are divided by the corresponding total number of reccomendations
W 		 : it is same as u just that each element is divided by the size, this will be later used for eigenvector computation
res4	 : the Markov matrix to get a unique solution
rankVect : the final one-dimensional matrix containing ranks of the initial pages 
 
Here, the method of power iteration is used to compute the eigenvectors.

Further, two functions have been defined :
	i) matrixMult : to multiply two matrices
	ii) endLoop   : to determine when the two matrices become roughly equal
